# Task Management and Project Tracking Plan

## Task Management

### Backend
1. Create a `Task` model with fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `dueDate`, and `assignedTo`.
2. Implement CRUD operations for tasks in the backend (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
3. Set up API routes for task management (e.g., `/api/tasks`).
4. Add validation for task inputs (e.g., required fields, valid dates).

### Frontend
1. Design a basic UI for task management (list, create, edit, delete tasks).
2. Integrate the task management API with the frontend.
3. Add state management for tasks (e.g., using Redux or Context API).
4. Implement basic error handling and loading states.

### Testing
1. Write unit tests for the task model and API routes.
2. Test the frontend components and API integration.

## Project Tracking

### Backend
1. Create a `Project` model with fields like `id`, `name`, `description`, `startDate`, `endDate`, and `tasks` (relation to Task model).
2. Implement CRUD operations for projects in the backend.
3. Set up API routes for project tracking (e.g., `/api/projects`).
4. Add validation for project inputs (e.g., required fields, valid dates).

### Frontend
1. Design a basic UI for project tracking (list, create, edit, delete projects).
2. Integrate the project tracking API with the frontend.
3. Add state management for projects.
4. Implement basic error handling and loading states.

### Testing
1. Write unit tests for the project model and API routes.
2. Test the frontend components and API integration.

## Organizing Tasks on a Project Board
1. Create a GitHub Project board with columns like `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.
2. Add tasks from the above sections as individual cards on the board.
3. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies (e.g., backend before frontend).
4. Regularly update the board to reflect progress.
